This version of model is **not** exactly the mentioned code in the source. <br/>
The original source code uses Keras. I have modified it to use tensorflow.keras instead of Keras. <br/>
And some other minor changes to make the code works properly with Python 3 and newer version of packages.
Two Pr_Train* scripts are added along with two small fake data for training/testing.<br/>

Notice:  <br/>
It is supposed that, the background (non VF values) is -1
